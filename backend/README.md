## instructions to run

going to have to run python app.. assuming that python3 is running on your machine already

from the CaseCycle/backend folder

create a virtual environment
`python3 -m venv .venv`

activating virtual environment (for macos/linux, different on windows a bit but idk off the top of my head)
`source .venv/bin/activate`
